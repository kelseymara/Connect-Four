# Connect Four ðŸ‘¾

## Overview
This Connect Four project was developed as a personal first exposure to Python. It is meant to provide an introductory learning experience and a foundation for building Python skills. 

## How to Play

To play the game:

1) Run the Python script to start the game.
2) Players take turns entering a column number (1-7) to drop their game piece into.
3) The first player to connect four of their pieces in a vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.
4) The game ends when a player wins or the board is filled, resulting in a draw.
   
## Future Improvements
Ways I can improve this project in the future include: 

- Print out when there is a draw
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game more visually appealing.
- Use Numpy for more efficient and optimized array operations, leading to improved performance and readability
