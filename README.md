# Connect Four ðŸ‘¾

## Overview
This Connect Four project was developed as a personal first exposure to Python. It is meant to provide an introductory learning experience and a foundation for building Python skills. 

## How to Run 
Download the python file, cd to the directory the file is in, and type in your terminal: 
```
python connect-four-v1.py
```
## How to play

1) Players take turns entering a column number (1-7) to drop their game piece into.
2) The first player to connect four of their pieces vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.
3) If the board fills up without a win, the game ends in a draw. 
   
## Future Improvements
Ways I can improve this project in the future include: 

- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game more visually appealing.
- Use Numpy for more efficient and optimized array operations, leading to improved performance and readability
